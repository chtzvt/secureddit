SSL extension for Reddit

Automatically redirects plain HTTP reddit.com to the encrypted, HTTPS secured version.

The NSA. The GHCQ. Russia. Cisco. Networking. The Internet.

I was trying to give this extension a bit of a sinister introduction, but I suppose I failed at that :/...

Anyways, behold! I give to you... SecuReddit! The first (and best) extension to automatically keep your leisurely Reddit browsing safe from prying eyes!

**What IS SecuReddit?

SecuReddit is an extension that makes use of the power of Chrome alongside the well known hack to use an HTTPS encrypted version of Reddit. 

Basically, it redirects reddit.com to https://pay.reddit.com, the purpose being that reddit.com is NOT encrypted, while https://pay.reddit.com IS. 

**Wait, what? Why do I need this extension? HTTPS, you say?

HTTP is an invaluable tool that keeps your web traffic (visiting web pages, viewing images, etc...) safe in transit. 

HTTP vs. HTTPS is comparable to sending something on a postcard (where there's no protection on it at all, and anyone can look at it and see what's there) vs putting your letter in an envelope (e.g. hiding your web traffic with encryption). 

Because of this, all major websites have turned on HTTPS by default, except for our beloved Reddit (Who's administrators have been dragging their feet on the issue for whatever reason), which necessitates this extension to supplement our needs for security on today's web.

**I can haz source?
Sure! It's on GitHub at: https://github.com/ctrezevant/secureddit/


The best part is, this extension accomplishes all of this quickly, automatically, and in the background. You just install it and you never have to think about it again.

Sleep peacefully, fellow redditors, knowing that you can now waste time on Reddit securely.
